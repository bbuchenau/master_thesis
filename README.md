# master_thesis
This is the repository for my master thesis.

I am using snscrape, tweepy and similar libraries to get data from social media 
and will perform deep learning computer vision analysis steps with ultralytics YOLOv8 and 
possibly other statistical ML methods.

The project is currently in a testing phase.
